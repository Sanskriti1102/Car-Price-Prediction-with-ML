## Problem Statement

As part of my AI/ML internship at InternPe, I undertook a project to analyze a comprehensive car dataset. The goal was to gain insights into the factors influencing car prices, develop a predictive model, and demonstrate data analysis and machine learning skills.

## Description

In this project, I tackled the following key tasks:

1. **Data Exploration**: I started by loading and exploring the car dataset, which contained valuable information about different car models, their specifications, and prices.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: To ensure reliable analysis, I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the data. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, and removing outliers.

3. **Data Visualization**: I used the seaborn library to create visually appealing plots that provided insights into car prices. I explored price distributions by car company, year, and fuel type. The use of various color palettes made the visualizations more engaging.

4. **Insightful Analysis**: To better understand the data, I delved into the relationship between car prices and kilometers driven. This analysis provided valuable insights into how mileage impacts car pricing.

5. **Machine Learning Model**: One of the highlights of this project was building a robust Linear Regression model using scikit-learn. I trained the model on the preprocessed data to predict car prices accurately.

6. **Model Persistence**: To ensure the model's reusability, I saved it using Python's `pickle` module. I also demonstrated how to load the trained model for future predictions.

## How It's Done

### Libraries Used
- Python 3.8+
- seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [quikr_car dataset link](https://github.com/Sanskriti1102/Car-Prize-Prediction-with-ML/blob/main/quikr_car.csv), containing information about various car models, their specifications, and prices.

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis and model building.

### Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš—
